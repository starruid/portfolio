        I always considered myself an artist, I have sketchbooks dating back to elementary school and doodles in the margins of nearly every assignment I have turned in. Most if it isn’t very good, but the passion has been there from the beginning. 
        <br>
        It stems from a need to create. Every book, show, or song I become fixated on inspires me in some way. I can spend hours in my head dreaming up stories and interesting characters, and art has always been my way of communicating those dreams to others. I don’t think I have ever considered going into any other career than art, much to my parents dismay. It’s always drawn me in, interested me in a way nothing else has. However as I’ve gotten older I’ve found more direction in my own art, and in my passions. I love creating, and that's something I want to pursue in my career. Specifically in the form of video games. I’m still a little conflicted on exactly how I want to work on creating games, but I would like to create art for them either way.
        <br>
        Character and environmental design is a major interest of mine, and it’s something I’ve done many times for personal projects. Though I’ve focused mostly on characters in previous art, I plan on expanding my skills to help me better create the stories I envision. I have a lot of ideas I would like to work on, and stories I would love to tell with others. 
        <br>
        I still have a lot to learn when it comes to digital media art. There are so many different ways to create art digitally, many of which I haven’t even tried. As I am interested in video games, I plan on pursuing those skills which will assist me in that area. I have enjoyed the little amount of creative coding that I have done so far, and I would love to try different things such as 3-D modeling. Overall, I look forward to continuing this journey and exploring all these artforms that will help me in my quest for creation.
