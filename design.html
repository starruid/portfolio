                  Artworks created in programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Indesign, and Illustrator. These works of graphic design include pieces that use photo manipulation as well as standard skills such as illustrative elements, filter overlays, and typography.

                This artwork required me to open up the code of an image and tamper with it until it created a glitching effect. I then took the glitched image, along with the original, into photoshop. Where I then cut and colleged them together to create a cohesive piece. <br>
<br>
In doing so I learned more about the way images are created digitally, and about all the possibilities that can be created by manipulating those photos, either through programs like Photoshop, or just by messing with the file itself.               </p>

Posters are a great way to share information or propaganda in a visually interesting and engaging way. I enjoy studying the different ways designers use type and images as graphic elements to create a cohesive image with a clear message<br>
As part of my worldbuilding for stories, I like to create posters that familiarize the viewer with the setting, giving them information about the different people and organizations while also invoking certain feelings using imagery and phrases.

I am also fond of the way posters are composed, the images and text working together, not just existing on the same canvas. It's an extremely versatile medium that we see often in our day to day lives.

As someone who has had a fascination with pirates for years, I knew I wanted my logo to take inspiration from the designs of jolly rogers. To create such an image, I had to go through multiple iterations. The images below show some examples of the different versions I had created. Even though the details may appear small, each one was considered when making something that would be visually pleasing and recognizable for branding. While iterative design can be tedious, it trains us to recognize the different elements of art and how to use them within our own work.

      As part of the iterative design, an alternate design was considered before returning to the design above. While still visually pleasing, the asymmetrical elements of the final design create more interest and movement in the logo.    </p></div>

Photoshop and image editing software allows me to alter and create images of a greater variety than my standard illustrations. For this piece I wanted to utilize multiple different elements of photoshop to create the fractured visual. The act of layering on filters and colors, copying and moving the illustrated elements helped me create this deeply emotional artwork. This was inspired by my own struggle when trying to recall old memories, specifically of my deceased father. <br> <br>
I included two versions, one in color to allow the vibrancy of the color to stand out. The other in black and white to allow the values and the texture to be highlighted.
