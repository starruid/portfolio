      Character design is a passion I have had for many years. Whenever I am creating a new story, I am often more drawn to the different people and relationships I can create than some of the other elements. This passion has led me to create many designs over the years, many I use in my free time for a variety of games I play with friends. <br>
<br>

While my designs tend to be more complicated then ones that would be made for media like cartoons or video games, I still like to use basic elements like shapes and colors to create starting points for my designs. Which I then add onto, taking inspiration from a variety of fashion and genres.

Aside from the characters made for my table top roleplaying game, I’ve also been slowly developing a fantasy story centered around a musician and a sailor searching for their deceased captain. The plot would explore their experience with grief and tackle the way society tends to strip the deceased of their complex personality and identity.<br>
This concept is incredably character focused, which is why I put a lot of thought into their designs.

                Occasionally, I am inspired by pieces of media to create art. This piece specifically depicts a very memorable scene from Jim Henson’s 1986 movie, Labyrinth. I love using layers within my drawings to create overlapping colors and textures that really bring life into the art. This drawing was a challenge in creating those different textures that make up the different parts of the dress while maintaining the consistent coloring. <br>

Since a lot of my drawings tend to focus on the figures within the art, I occasionally add graphic design elements like typography to create more of a poster-like art piece. This work depicts two of my own original characters with the title and lyric from the song Southern Nights by Glen Campbell.<br>
